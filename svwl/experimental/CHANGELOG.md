# Changelog
## 5.1-22.09.a "Old Alchemist" (Feb 28, 2022)
Welcome to first experimental release! This update adds small improvements to the game. 

Unfortunately there isn't any update checkers present on SMAPI. The auto-update might be released very soon but we are not sure when this will be available.
We will let you know with development update if we found any solution!

### Highlight
* Now NPC locations are displayed on the map! Now you don't need to miss opportunity to talk to npcs or miss your remaining quests anymore.
* There was an earthquake on your farm... Now your farm have been expanded for better farming!
* Node textures has been improved to match their surroundings based on current environment and other colors of nearby rocks.
* There was an update since 5.0(Previously 2022.01) has been released... Don't forget to check any updates of the mod!
