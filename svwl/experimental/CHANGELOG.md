Welcome to second experimental release of 5.1 series! This update brings huge changes into the game, such as environment visual improvements, new building mode, crafting improvements and additional cosmetics!

### Release Highlight
* **Major environment visual overhaul has arrived on experimental branch!** The environment has been recolored and some elements are now randomized, while keeping original Stardew Valley atmospheres.
* **New feature: Building mode!** Now it is quicker and easier to build your own farm without having to build it slowly. This feature might be useful for builders!
* **Crafting UI has been improved!** Now it features categories, favorites, uniform grid size and some exploit fixes.
* **New hairstyles, cosmetics, and Hand Mirror item!** Now with Hand Mirror item, you don't have to start all over again to change your looks anymore.
* **Replaced Official - Industrialization to PFM version** due to the mod being outdated and no longer updated anymore, we decided to change the mod base of industrialization mod to PFM version.
* [Karei](https://twitter.com/flat_fish_)'s portrait mod(Fisharia portrait mod) has been changed to Unofficial CP version (Now simply put the folder into Mods folder and you are done!)
* Removed Real Weather due to issue with mechanics (This mod will not be added back into the game in the future)

Again, don't forget to check any updates of the mod (Especially if you didn't)! Unfortunately you will need to check for updates manually by yourself.
