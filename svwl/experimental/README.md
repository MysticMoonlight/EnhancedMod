## Frequently Asked Questions (A.K.A FAQ)
Please read the FAQ below before making an issue.

### Will there be Mobile/Console support?
Console is obviously no, as they does not support modding.
Mobile has lack of features compared with PC version, so it will less likely be supported.

### Why you didn't add huge mod like Stardew Valley: Expanded? I would like to see them!
Remember, this is independent and community made project and it is NOT intended to support other big mods.
The most reason why we are not adding mods like SVE is because of NPC support and gameplay changes that we cannot afford.

The [Fisharia anime portraits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10442) mod was made by [Karei](https://twitter.com/flat_fish_) and it currently only supports the main NPCs included on base game, and that means the artstyles will be totally ruined for new NPC additions. Unless Karei decide to support big mod like SVE, this is unlikely be added to our modpack and will be the independent modpack instead.
