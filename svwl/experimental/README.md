# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Please read the FAQ below before making an issue.

**Q) Where did the older features go?**

**A)** Most of features has been removed in favor of staying true to what made Stardew Stardew.


**Q) What will happen to old version?**

**A)** The old version will be renamed to 'Stardew Valley: Wildlife Legacy Edition' and no support will be given to that version.


**Q) So, what happened to the direction of the project?**

**A)** After working on SDV:W, the current list didn't closely resemble the vanilla experience and changed the gameplay too much. Plus, there was a lot of bloat. Not to mention, the artstyle (including the UI) was way too different, causing disparities to the average player looking for something familiar. So, we decided to shift direction to keep the artstyle to vanilla but expanding with slight gameplay additions and improvements.


**Q) What's changed?**

**A)** There's a lot to unpack, here. But to keep a long story short, it is mostly focused on UI/portrait changes, and new date system, and some changes to the feature. This branch aims to simplify the list of mods by keeping things original with slight.


**Q) Will there be mobile/console support?**

**A)** Consoles lack modding tools and won't be supported here.
Mobile lacks features compared to the PC version, so support won't be prioritized.


**Q) Why didn't you add big mods like Stardew Valley: Expanded? I'd love to see them!**

**A)** This is an independently curated list and we will not be supporting large additions by default. However, in the case of SVE, the biggest reason is mod compatibility, NPC support, and gameplay changes too large to currently account for.
