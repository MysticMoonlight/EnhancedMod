# Team Fortress 2 Classic: Enhanced 
Team Fortress 2 Classic: Enhanced is the modpack focused on improving overall visuals and sound effects while keeping original TF2C atmosphere. It is sister project of Team Fortress 2: Enhanced.

This modpack requires Team Fortress 2 Classic. Currently official downloads are not available at the moment. However [unofficial mirror](https://gg.apple-shack.org/tf2c/) can be found here but it is at your own risk. As the site says, **DO NOT share that mirror on TF2Classic official discord**, otherwise you can be bonked from TF2C community forever.
