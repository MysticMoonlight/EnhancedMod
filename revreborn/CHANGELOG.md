## Revengeance Reborn 8.0-2022.16a "Furious Wings" (April 26, 2022)
Welcome to second experimental release of Revengeance Reborn! After long hiatus, we are happy to announce the second experimental version of Revengeance Reborn.

Unfortunately we had to remove mod during the changes so we forgot what we removed, so you'll have to unsubscribe all addons and resubscribe to this collection again. Sorry!

### Highlights
* New blood textures!
* Objects and routes will always change for each gameplay
* Added healing troll prevention mechanism - Shoving survivors who is healing you will now cause the healing progress cancelled
* Survivors who had low health will now be healed automatically on saferoom
* Skybox and color correction changes once again
* Door props are now fixed
* Removed Explosion Flash again to prevent possible lags upon explosion
* Improved Bot script (You'll have to do additional steps while installing this collections)
* Improved navigation files and populations

### List of mods
No.
