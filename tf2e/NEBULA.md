* Strictly uses default HUD with few tweaks, so custom HUDs are no longer compatible
* New optional crosshair mod
* New character looks on main menu/portrait thanks to SOUP mod

# How to Install

* Put the folder or vpk file to `tf/custom` folder inside Local Files (To access local files, Go to Properties -> Local Files -> Browse...)
