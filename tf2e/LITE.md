# Team Fortress 2: Enhanced Lite
Team Fortress 2: Enhanced is the modpack focused on improving overall visuals and sound effects while keeping original TF2 atmosphere.

Due to license issue, the modpack will not be available, so you must download it on their mod page manually.

This version is lite version of Team Fortress 2: Enhanced, aiming for complete sv_pure 1/Valve server compatibility.

# Changelog
See [here](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EnhancedMod/blob/main/tf2e/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install
1. Extract the archive file you downloaded (It should be `.zip`, `.rar`, or `.7z`)
2. Put the folder or vpk file to `tf/custom` folder inside Local Files (To access local files, Go to Properties -> Local Files -> Browse...)
	* 2-1. **Attention to Linux/macOS Users!** If the folder contains uppercase and space, you must rename the folder to contain only lowercase/underscore/hyphen otherwise TF2 cannot detect the folder mod(s) upon launch!
3. Launch the game, enjoy the modpack!

## Additional Steps (Optional)
You need to do additional steps when installing SOUP and TF2 Community HUD Fixes together, in case if you wish to use both mod seperately.

If you are unsure what to do, it is okay to skip this step and just install the default SOUP version (But be warned, it may contain an outdated HUD Fixes version).

Here's how to do that:

1. Download the latest [TF2 Community HUD Fixes](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/TF2HUD.Fixes/archive/refs/heads/workshop.zip), then extract the zip folder.
2. Download the art only version of SOUP [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/download/26400), then extract the archive.
3. Locate to `art-only-soup-vXXX` folder (XXX is the version name), then move the `materials` and `scripts` to HUD Fixes file.
4. Move the hud folder you changed to custom folder (You know where it is because we already explained it above).
5. Launch the game and you're done! Enjoy the latest TF2 HUD Fixes with this patch.
