# EnhancedMod - Our Standards
Welcome to EnhancedMod! Here is the standard we follow when making the Enhanced Mod series, and it will be applied for every Enhanced Mod in the future. We recommend you to read whole article when creating your own modpack in the future!

### Keep it simple, stupid!
We follow the [KISS principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) when creating our project. This modpack series also applies too! We carefully cherry-picks the mod, then we check the mods if there is compatibility with current version and other mods, or known issue.

### Do not try to change game too much
Our project is to improve and fix the original game with mods, and it is NOT supposed to change the game too much, like bloats.

### Only originals are accepted
We only adds mod which uses original game or self-made content. We do not tolerate adding things that is from other sources. (e.g. Games, Artwork, Franchises which doesn't present in-game)

This does not applies to Optional mods, which respects user's decision to install the mods or not.

### Performance matters
Performance is really important for better gameplay experience. Never add mod which can affect performance unless it does the opposite (Which improves performance)

### Always remember the fair-play
We want to play games fairly, and do not want to give users unfair advantage compared to other users. We also strictly not allows adding mod which can affect the gameplay.

### No more limitations: Cross-platform
Regardless of any platform, the mod should follow the cross-platform support so people can enjoy the same gameplay experience.
