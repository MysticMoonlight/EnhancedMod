[We recommend you to use this mod collection as a base if you are unsure.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697485771)

## Eurasia Classic
Formerly known as Vanilla, Eurasia Classic Combo uses EuRoadNet as a base, and expands the map to Eurasia. It keeps vanilla atmosphere while improving the SCS map. Mod order referenced from [this post](https://www.roextended.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2229). (Thanks to GMC Logistics for the mod order)

**Known issue:** Currently EuRoadNet does not support Special Transport DLC. Consider using Minimal Edition if you wish to do Special Transport jobs.

This edition features the following map mods: EuRoadNet, RusMap, JRR, Southern Region, The Great Steppe, Road to Asia, ROEXTENDED and AZGE (Optional) and more.
