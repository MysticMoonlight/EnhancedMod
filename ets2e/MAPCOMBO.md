# Starlight ETS2 Map Combos
Welcome to Starlight ETS2 Map Combos! We decided to share the map combo that we use.

We carefully cherry-picked map mods carefully to avoid any compatibility issue on future update of ETS2 and their mods.

We offer two following combos:
* Vanilla Combo
* Eurasia Combo

## Recommended General Mod Orders
The general mod load orders should be the following:
* Map/Loading Background Mods
* UI Mods
* (Optional) [Realistic Rain](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787041596)
* (Optional) [Grimes Weather Mod](https://grimesmods.wordpress.com/)
* Sounds
* Graphics / Weather
* Others
* Physics
* Tuning Parts / Paintjobs
* (Optional) Traffic Density Mods
* AI / Traffic mods
* Trailers
* Trucks
* Maps

[We recommend you to use this mod collection as a base if you are unsure.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697485771)
