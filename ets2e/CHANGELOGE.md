## ETS2: Enhanced 44.0-beta4 (March 12, 2022)
Welcome to fourth beta of ETS2: Enhanced 44.0! This update includes version scheme reverts, replacement of Police Tweaks mod, and removal of DOWL's Skybox Mod. Unless there is serious issue that needs to be resolved, this beta release probably might be the last one for ETS2: Enhanced 44.0 branch.

### Highlights
* New version scheme applied! We actually reverted back to previous version name to keep follow the ETS2 version name.
* Replaced erbkaiser's Police Tweaks with Roon's Police Tweaks since erbkaiser's Police Tweaks made the game much easy.
* Removed DOWL's Skybox mod due to glitch during weather changes compared with Vanilla version
