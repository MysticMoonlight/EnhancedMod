# Enhanced Mod Series
Enhanced Mod Series is a collection of modpacks developed by Mystic Moonlight and community contributors. Initially this project started on June 16th, 2021 as a single modpack. Following that, we've continuously added improvements and expansions for more game support, and now we've consolidated it down to one massive project.

This repository is a compilation of modpacks we've made, so you can find them easily on one page.
