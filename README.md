# Enhanced Mod Series
Enhanced Mod Series are the collection of modpacks developed by Mystic Moonlight. Initially this project was begun as Team Fortress 2: Enhanced since Jun 16, 2021, and we continously made improvement and expansion and now it become one of biggest project named EnhancedMod and actively being maintained by passionate mod lover [Roon](https://twitter.com/Roon_Moonlight) and several project contributors.

Our modpack series aims to be original-friendly and simplicity: Which does not include any of assets from other franchises if possible, and keeping original atmosphere of the game, and removing unnecessary features that are not required.

This repository is the compiliation of modpacks we made, so you can find them easily on one page.
