# Enhanced Mod Series
Enhanced Mod Series are the collection of modpacks developed by Mystic Moonlight. Initially this project was begun as Team Fortress 2: Enhanced since Jun 16, 2021, and we continously made improvement and expansion and now it become one of biggest project named EnhancedMod and actively being maintained by passionate mod lover [Roon](https://twitter.com/Roon_Moonlight) and several project contributors.

Our modpack series aims to be original-friendly and simplicity: Which does not include any of assets from other franchises if possible, and keeping original atmosphere of the game, and removing unnecessary features that are not required.
