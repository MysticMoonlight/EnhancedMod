# Enhanced Mod Series
Enhanced Mod Series is a collection of modpacks developed by Mystic Moonlight. Initially this project started as Team Fortress 2: Enhanced on June 16th, 2021. Following that, we've continuously added improvements and expansions, and now we've consolidated it down to one massive project. Currently, it is actively maintained by passionate mod lover [Roon](https://twitter.com/Roon_Moonlight) and several other project contributors.

Our modpack series aims to be vanilla-friendly and simplistic yet nuanced: Which does not include any assets from other franchises, if possible; keeping the original atmosphere of the game; and removing unnecessary features.

This repository is a compilation of modpacks we've made, so you can find them easily on one page.
